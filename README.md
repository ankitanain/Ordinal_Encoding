# Ordinal_Encoding
"Original encoding" typically refers to the initial representation or format of data as it is originally received or collected. This representation is often in its most raw and unprocessed form. In various fields, including data analysis, computer science, and data storage, the original encoding refers to the way information is structured or formatted when it's first obtained.

For example, in the context of text data, the original encoding might be in the form of plain text, which includes characters, symbols, and formatting as they were entered or received. This original encoding can later be transformed or processed into other formats or representations, such as numerical data or specific data structures, for analysis or storage. It's important to understand and work with the original encoding properly to ensure data integrity and accurate processing.
